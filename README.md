**Repository Title: COVID-19 Data Exploration SQL Queries**

**Description:**

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries used for exploring COVID-19 data, including data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics. These queries were performed on the Covid_Data database and focus on various aspects of the pandemic, with the goal of gaining insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and populations.

**SQL Query Highlights:**

Viewing the Entire Data: The initial query provides a broad overview of the COVID-19 dataset, filtering for data related to continents and ordering by location and date.

Total Cases vs Total Deaths: This query calculates the death percentage, shedding light on the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in specific regions, such as states.

Total Cases vs Population: This query highlights what percentage of the population has been infected with COVID-19 in different regions.

Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.

Countries with Highest Death Count per Population: Lists countries with the highest death counts per population.

Breaking Things Down by Continent: This set of queries explores continents with the highest death counts per population, helping to identify regions heavily impacted by the virus.

Global Numbers: Summarizes global COVID-19 numbers, including total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.

Total Population vs Vaccinations: Investigates the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, including a rolling calculation of people vaccinated.

Using CTE and Temp Table: Demonstrates different approaches to perform calculations using Common Table Expressions (CTE) and temporary tables.

Creating a View: Illustrates how to create a view to store data for future visualizations or reporting.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries and their descriptions for a deeper understanding of the insights gained from the COVID-19 data. These queries showcase various techniques for data analysis and can be used as a reference for your data exploration projects.
